- **Interest & Loan Tracker:** A utility to simulate and track interest rates and financial projections.
- **Financial Dashboard:** A centralized view of management data.

I am currently showcasing my proficiency in:
- **Backend:** PHP 8.x / Laravel 11+
- **Frontend:** Vue 3 (Composition API) & Inertia.js
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Database:** MySQL / PostgreSQL

> **Note:** I am currently migrating my ecosystem and learning **React & Next.js** to further expand my full-stack capabilities for the international market.
